******Data Structures******

A data structure is a particular way of organizing and storing data in a computer so that it can be accessed and modified efficiently. More precisely, a data structure is a collection of data values, the relationships among them, and the functions or operations that can be applied to the data.

******Linear and non-linear data structures******

Linear data structures are structures where data elements are arranged sequentially or linearly. Each element is connected to its previous and next element. Examples of linear data structures include arrays, stacks, queues, and linked lists.

Non-linear data structures are structures where data elements are not arranged sequentially or linearly. Elements can be connected to multiple other elements, forming a branching or hierarchical structure. Examples of non-linear data structures include trees, graphs, and heaps.

# Algorithms
An algorithm is an unambiguous specification of how to solve a class of problems. It is a set of rules that precisely define a sequence of operations.

## Useful Information


### Big O Notation

*Big O notation* is used to classify algorithms according to how their running time or space requirements grow as the input size grows.
On the chart below you may find most common orders of growth of algorithms specified in Big O notation.

Source: [Big O Cheat Sheet](http://bigocheatsheet.com/).

Below is the list of some of the most used Big O notations and their performance comparisons against different sizes of the input data.
